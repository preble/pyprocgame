## pyprocgame

pyprocgame is a high-level pinball development framework for use with P-ROC (Pinball Remote Operations Controller).  It was written by Adam Preble and Gerry Stellenberg.  More information about P-ROC is available at [pinballcontrollers.com](http://pinballcontrollers.com/).  See the [pyprocgame site](http://pyprocgame.pindev.org/) for the full pyprocgame documentation.

## Prerequisites

pyprocgame requires the following:

- [Python 3.7+](http://python.org/)
- [pypinproc](http://github.com/preble/pypinproc) -- native Python extension enabling P-ROC hardware access and native DMD frame manipulation.
- [setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) -- required for procgame script installation.  Also adds easy\_install, a helpful installer tool for popular Python modules.
- [pyyaml](http://pyyaml.org/) -- YAML parsing.
- One of the Python graphics and sound modules:
  - [pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/)
  - [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/)
- [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (PIL)

## Installation

To install pyprocgame: (depending on your system configuration you may need to use _sudo_)

	python setup.py install

This will install pyprocgame such that you can import it from any Python script on your system:

	import procgame.game

It will also install the "procgame" command line tool into a system-dependent location.  On Linux and Mac OS X systems this will probably be in your path such that you can type, from the command line:

	procgame

and see a list of available commands.  If it is not in your path you can invoke it directly, or modify your PATH environment variable.  Note that on Windows the procgame script is typically located in C:\Python26\Scripts.

## Documentation

Please see the [pyprocgame Documentation](http://pyprocgame.pindev.org/) site for the pyprocgame Manual and detailed API documentation.
