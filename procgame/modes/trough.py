class Trough(Mode):
    """Manages trough by providing the following functionality:

        - Keeps track of the number of balls in play
        - Keeps track of the number of balls in the trough
        - Launches one or more balls on request and calls a launch_callback when complete, if one exists.
        - Auto-launches balls while ball save is active (if linked to a ball save object
        - Identifies when balls drain and calls a registered drain_callback, if one exists.
        - Maintains a count of balls locked in playfield lock features (if externally incremented) and adjusts the count of number of balls in play appropriately.  This will help the drain_callback distinguish between a ball ending or simply a multiball ball draining.

    Parameters:

        'game': Parent game object.
        'position_switchnames': List of switchnames for each ball position in the trough.
        'eject_switchname': Name of switch in the ball position the feeds the shooter lane.
        'eject_coilname': Name of coil used to put a ball into the shooter lane.
        'early_save_switchnames': List of switches that will initiate a ball save before the draining ball reaches the trough (ie. Outlanes).
        'shooter_lane_switchname': Name of the switch in the shooter lane.  This is checked before a new ball is ejected.
        'drain_callback': Optional - Name of method to be called when a ball drains (and isn't saved).
